## Installation

```sh
npm install @hnp/package-scripts --save-dev
```

## Usage

This tool is meant to be used as part of the `npm` package scripts in your `package.json`.

### `compile`

Updates the project files.

-   Normalizes `package.json`.

    -   Uses [normalize-package-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/normalize-package-data) for basic normalization.
    -   Ensures the `git-remote` matches the `git.url` field.
    -   Sets the `git.url` as the `SSH` version. _Usefull on CI and Deployments_
    -   Formats the `author` field as the single line form. `name <email> (homepage)`
    -   Updates the `contributors` field using the `git history` and the `GitHub API`
    -   Ensures a valid `licence` field.
    -   Cleans the results of empty fields and saves a new `package.json`

-   Updates the `README.md` _Trying its best to make it [standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/blob/master/spec.md) compilant_
    -   Matches the Title to the package name
    -   Matches the description to the package description
    -   Updates `## Table of contents`.
    -   Updates `## Installation`.
        -   If the `package.json` field `private` is `true` it will be `git clone && npm install`
        -   If the `package.json` field `preferGlobal` is `true` it will be `npm install -g`
        -   If the `package.json` field `preferDev` is `true` it will be `npm install -D`
        -   If none of those rules matches it will be `npm install --save`
    -   Updates `## Usage` by executing the contents of `example.js` or `examples/index.js` as a `code block`.
        -   `\\ Comments` are converted to `paragraphs`
        -   `console.log()` statements are replaced by what the console prints.
    -   Updates `## Maintainers` using the `AUTHORS` file.
    -   Links `## Changelog` to the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
    -   Links `## Licence` to the `LICENCE` file.
    -   Scans the resulting document and creates links to repositories, pull requests, issues etc.
-   Updates the `AUTHORS` file.
-   Updates the `LICENCE` file using [@hnp/license-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hnp/license-generator)
-   Updates the `TODO.md` file using [leasot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leasot)
    -   Opt out by using the `--no-todos` flag.
    -   Uses the closest `.gitignore` to figure it out which files scan fot TODOs
-   Stages the changed files. _Making it useful as a pre-commit hook_

### `todos`

> If the tool is already going to install [leasot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leasot) at least should expose it.

-   Uses the closest `.gitignore` to figure it out which files scan for TODOs

### `version`

> A thin wrapper over [standard-version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard-version) for convenience.

-   It will run `package-scripts compile` as a `post-version-bump hook` to keep everything up to date. You can override this hook with `--post-bump=${yourcommand}`
-   If no `CHANGELOG.md` file is found, it will create one as a `first-release` without bumping the version.
